    <h1>Carlos Marin Rodriguez</h1>
    <h2>Double Major in Applied Personal Finance & Computing Applications</h2>
    <p>For my career, the final major goal I have is to become a CFP certified financial advisor. I want to eventually be an independent advisor for several clients and build a high reputation as a successful well-regarded financial advisor. However, there are several steps required before I can achieve my final goal, such as getting my bachelor's degree. </p>

    <p>My short-term goals I have currently for my career is to graduate next year with my bachelor's degree. Then, I will work toward passing the CFP test and gain experience toward becoming a financial advisor by either working as a paraplanner or financial advisor trainee. To create a better opportunity to succeed and advance my career, I would want to move into a bigger city that has more potential for more job openings and higher pay rate.</p>
